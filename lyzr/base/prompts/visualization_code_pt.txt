This is a Critical Scenario. The CEO has asked you to write Python code to create visualization that answers his question on a given dataframe, based on the instructions given by Senior Data Scientist
        
CEO: "{user_input}"

Dataframe Head: 
{df_head}

Data Scientist's Instructions:
{instructions}

Dataframe coloumns:
{df_columns}

Here is a sample output for the Python Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import <necessory_libraries> # import ALL the necessory libraries

def function_name(dataframe):
    # Write your Python Function here that creates visualizations that answer's CEO's Question
    # Save the visualizations with proper labels, names and extensions(in .png format)
    # Do not display the visualization just save it.

# Assume `df` is already defined
function_name(df) # Call the function that you wrote with the dataframe as the argument
```
Now, Write down python code to create Visualizations answer the CEO's question: {user_input}
