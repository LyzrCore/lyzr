Present the output as a Python list of length {count_recommendations}, with the following schema:
{json_schema}

Use double quotes (") to begin and end strings.
Only share this list as your output, to be evaluated with eval() in Python.
Rank all your insights and only share the top {count_recommendations} ones.
