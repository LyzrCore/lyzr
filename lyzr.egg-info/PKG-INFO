## Installation

You can install the `lyzr` package directly from PyPI:

```console
pip install lyzr
```

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build the `lyzr` package from source, you'll need to have Python installed along with `setuptools` and `wheel`. 

### Steps to Build:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project (where `setup.py` is located).
3. Run the following commands:

```console
# Ensure setuptools and wheel are installed
pip install setuptools wheel

# Build the package
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

This will generate a `dist` directory containing the built package files.

### Installing the Built Package:

Once you've built the package, you can install it using pip:

```console
cd dist/
pip install lyzr-[version]-py3-none-any.whl
```

Replace `[version]` with the actual version of the package you have built.
