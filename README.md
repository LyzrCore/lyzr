## Installation

You can install the `lyzr` package directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lyzr/):

```console
pip install lyzr
```

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build the `lyzr` package from source, you'll need to have Python installed along with `setuptools` and `wheel`.

### Steps to Build

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project (where `setup.py` is located).
3. Run the following commands:

```console
# Ensure setuptools and wheel are installed
pip install setuptools wheel

# Build the package
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

This will generate a `dist` directory containing the built package files.

### Installing the Built Package

Once you've built the package, you can install it using pip:

```console
cd dist/
pip install lyzr-[version]-py3-none-any.whl
```

Replace `[version]` with the actual version of the package you have built.

## Example

### Launch an agent in just few lines of code

1. Install the Lyzr library.

```python
pip install lyzr
```

2. Import the necessary agent module. Here we are choosing ChatBot module.

```python
from lyzr import ChatBot
```

3. Provision the chatbot with just 1-line of code. The RAG pipeline runs in the background.

```python
my_chatbot = ChatBot.pdf_chat(input_files=["pdf_file_path"])
```

4. That’s it. Just query and start chatting with your chatbot.

```python
response = chatbot.chat("Your question here")
```
